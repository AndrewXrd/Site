            <p className='context-aboutme'>Hey there! I am Andrew, a passionate BSc in IT undergraduate with a love for building digital experiences that look great and feel right. As a UI/UX Designer and Front-End Developer, I blend creativity with clean, efficient code to craft interfaces that users enjoy exploring. I am currently diving deep into full-stack development (especially the MERN stack), sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I can also leverage AI efficiently in every aspect of my work. From design ideas and development optimization to problem-solving and creativity. Beyond the screen, I am a huge fan of movies, video games, anime and pop culture because storytelling inspires the way I design. I believe great design is not just seen, it is felt.</p>
